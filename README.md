<p>Note: Currently, no browser fully supports these features. Firefox doesn't support hash marks and labels at all, for example, while Chrome supports hash marks but doesn't support labels. Version 66 (66.0.3359.181) of Chrome supports labels but the 'datalist' tag has to be styled with CSS as its display property is set to none by default, hiding the labels.</p>
